  <p i18n="@@about__p1">
    PIRAT (Pandemic Important Resource Allocation Tool) is a tool to register and efficiently distribute necessary
    resources in exceptional situations such as a pandemic.
  </p>
  <p i18n="@@about__p2">
    We want to improve the collection and distribution of necessary medical equipment, but also manpower. Many
    university laboratories are well equipped to perform diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2, but they lack the
    authorization to perform these tests, so patient samples cannot be analyzed. Official test laboratories would
    need the equipment of these laboratories, as the demand for SARS-CoV-2 testing exceeds their capacity, but
    this exchange does not exist yet.
  </p>
  <p i18n="@@about__p3">
    Therefore, the aim of this site is to connect test laboratories with institutions such as universities that
    could provide equipment, consumables and qualified staff to assist in performing SARS-CoV-2 tests.
    Universities can enter their free resources in our database and will be notified as soon as one of the
    surrounding test laboratories needs these resources. This expands testing capacities so that suspected cases
    can be tested more quickly.
  </p>
  <p i18n="@@about__p4">
    In addition, one could also start with patient swabs and the transport of samples to the test laboratories
    already, where additional manpower acquired from the universities could ensure that suspected cases can be
    tested quickly. Here, close cooperation with the health authorities is planned.
  </p>
  <p i18n="@@about__p5">
    Of course, the tool can also be extended to other consumables that are currently in short supply in hospitals
    and in the emergency or nursing services (e.g. gloves, masks, protective goggles, disinfectants; first
    attempts of donations from universities to hospitals are currently happening very uncoordinatedly), as well as
    further manpower in terms of hospital or rescue service staff.
  </p>
  <p i18n="@@about__p6">
    In summary, the current problem is that there are resources in the form of staff, equipment and consumables
    that are needed elsewhere, but there is no exchange between the relevant bodies. This situation is
    considerably improved by our tool.
