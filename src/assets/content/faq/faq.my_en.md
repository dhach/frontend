The aim of this page is to connect Covid19 test laboratories and health authorities with institutions such as universities and research institutes, which could provide equipment, consumable(s) and qualified personnel(s) to assist in the execution of Covid19 test(s).

### I have no experience with the methods mentioned, but I still want to help. What can I do?

We are also looking to bring qualified volunteers for the transportation of samples and consumables to the appropriate locations.


## For Donor Institutions

### How can I offer material / personnel?

Material(s) and personnel(s) can be offered on our website. To do this, a questionnaire must be completed so that the test facilities/hospitals can search for the required resource(s) accordingly.

### How can the material transport work? What happens if my device is damaged during transport?

Given the nature of this initiative as voluntary services, we seek the arrangement of transport and cost, managed between Seekers and Providers.  

### How is my staff insured?

The test facilities are supported by student(s) and university staff(s) on a voluntary basis. Volunteer(s) are encouraged to sign a Volunteer Agreement, which has to be prepared by the test laboratories/hospitals. 



## For Recipients

### How can I request material / personnel?

You can search for material(s) and personnel(s) in our offer database, divided into the following categories: device(s), consumable(s) and personnel(s). Within these categories you will find the offers of the universities/institutes with the exact specifications (e.g. device designation, number of consumables, employee qualifications etc.)

### Are there any offers in my area?

You may check availability by sorting via postcode / city / state and generally the easiest way of transfer is for institutions that are nearby.

### How much does it cost to rent equipment?

To borrow equipment(s), the transport costs incurred must always be borne by the receiving institution; further agreements can be made in direct consultation between the parties involved.
