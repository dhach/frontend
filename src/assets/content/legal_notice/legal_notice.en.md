### Legal notice:

**§ 1 Warning regarding contents** The free of charge and freely accessible contents of this website were created with the greatest possible care. However, the provider of this website accepts no responsibility for the correctness and up-to-dateness of this content. Contributions identified by name reflect the opinion of the respective author and not always the opinion of the provider. No contractual relationship is established between the user and the provider simply by calling up the free of charge and freely accessible content; in this respect the provider lacks the will to legally bind himself.

**§ 2 Externe Links** This website contains links to third party websites ("external links"). These websites are subject to the liability of the respective operators. When the external links were first created, the provider checked the external content for any legal violations. At that time no legal violations were apparent. The provider has no influence on the current and future design and content of the linked sites. The setting of external links does not mean that the provider adopts the contents behind the reference or link as his own. The provider cannot reasonably be expected to constantly monitor the external links without concrete evidence of legal violations. However, if violations of the law become known, such external links will be deleted immediately.

**§ 3 Copyright and ancillary copyright** The contents published on this website are subject to German copyright and ancillary copyright law. Any use not permitted under German copyright and ancillary copyright law requires the prior written consent of the provider or the respective rights holder. This applies in particular to copying, editing, translation, storage, processing or reproduction of contents in databases or other electronic media and systems. Contents and rights of third parties are marked as such. Unauthorised reproduction or transmission of individual contents or complete pages is not permitted and is punishable by law. Only the production of copies and downloads for personal, private and non-commercial use is permitted. The presentation of this website in external frames is only permitted with written permission.

**§ 4 Special terms of use** If special terms for individual uses of this website deviate from the aforementioned paragraphs, this will be expressly pointed out in the corresponding place. In this case, the special terms of use apply in each individual case.
