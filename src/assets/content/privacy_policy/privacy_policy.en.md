### Information on Data Processing:

Below, we inform you about the type, scope, purpose and legal basis of the collection, processing and use of personal data.

#### Provision of Our Website and Creation of Log Files
If you use our website for informational purposes only (i.e. no registration or other transmission of information), we only collect the personal data that your browser transmits to our server. This data is not stored together with other personal data about you. If you wish to view our website, we collect the following data:

- IP address
- Date and time of request
- Browser type
- Content of the request
- Access status/HTTP status code
- Data volume

The legal basis for this is our legitimate interest in data processing in accordance with Art. 6 (1) 1 f) GDPR. This data serves the purpose of user-friendly, functional and secure delivery of our website to you with functions and contents as well as their optimization and statistical evaluation.

For security reasons, we store this data in server log files for a storage period of up to 30 days. After this period has elapsed, they are deleted or anonymized for the purposes of scientific evaluation, unless we need to store them for evidence in the event of attacks on the server infrastructure or other legal infringements.

#### Setting and Adapting Offers
On our website you can publish offers for medical aids and laboratory equipment. You can also place an advertisement as a volunteer. If you make use of this offer, we will process and publish your advertisement with reference to the postcode provided. In the case of volunteers, details concerning the institution and research group will also be published. Further contact details will not be published, but other users can send a message to the email address you have provided via a contact form.
This data is needed to enable the matchmaking of devices and volunteers. The legal basis for this is Art. 6 (1) a) GDPR. You give us your consent by marking the checkbox at the end of the offer form. You can revoke your consent at any given time by informing us via email. We will then delete your offer and the matchmaking will not be possible afterwards.

#### Contact Requests and Matchmaking
If you contact us or other users via contact form or e-mail, the data you provide will be used to process your request. The data is required to process and answer your enquiry - without the provision of this data, we cannot answer your enquiry or facilitate a matchmaking. 
The legal basis for this processing is Art. 6 (1) b) GDPR.
Your data will be deleted if your inquiry has been conclusively answered and the deletion does not conflict with any legal storage obligations, as for example in the case of a possible subsequent contract processing.

#### Use of Google reCAPTCHA
We use "Google reCAPTCHA" (hereinafter "reCAPTCHA") on our websites. The provider is Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA ("Google"). The purpose of reCAPTCHA is to check whether the data input on our website (e.g. in a contact form) is made by a human being or by an automated program. For this purpose, the reCAPTCHA response will be used to forward the IP address, access location and time to Google. The data processing takes place on the basis of art. 6 (1) f) GDPR. The site operator has a legitimate interest in protecting his web offers from abusive automated spying and from SPAM. By using reCAPTCHA, you also agree to Google's privacy policy. For more information about Google reCAPTCHA and Google's privacy policy, please see the following links: https://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy/ and https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/android.html.

### Transfer of Personal Data to Third Parties and Order Processors

Without your consent, we will not pass on any data to third parties. Should this be the case anyways, the transfer will be made on the basis of the aforementioned legal bases, e.g. due to a court order or due to a legal obligation to surrender the data for the purpose of criminal prosecution, to avert danger or to enforce intellectual property rights. 
We also use order processors (external service providers for web hosting of our website, databases and email servers) to process your data. If data is passed on to the processors within the framework of an agreement for order processing, this is always done in accordance with Art. 28 GDPR. We select our processors carefully, check them regularly and have been granted the right to issue instructions regarding the data. In addition, the processors must have taken suitable technical and organizational measures and comply with the data protection regulations according to BDSG and GDPR. We host this website on servers of the Unesty Company, Geschwister-Scholl-Platz 5, 09648 Mittweida, Germany. Matchmaking runs through our mailserver at the united-domains AG, Gautinger Straße 10, 82319 Starnberg, Germany. 

### Transfer of Data to Third Countries

The adoption of the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has created a uniform basis for data protection in Europe. If processing is carried out by services of third parties outside the European Union or the European Economic Area, they must comply with the special requirements of Art. 44 ff. GDPR. This means that the processing is carried out on the basis of special guarantees, such as the EU Commission's officially recognized determination of a level of data protection corresponding to that of the EU or the observance of officially recognized special contractual obligations, the so-called "standard contractual clauses". In the case of US companies, submission to the so-called "Privacy-Shield", the data protection agreement between the EU and the USA, fulfils these requirements. 
Your data will be processed exclusively by companies to which the GDPR applies or which have joined the Privacy-Shield in the context of the use of Google reCAPTCHA (see above).


### Deletion of Data and Storage Duration

Unless expressly stated in this data protection declaration, your personal data will be deleted or blocked as soon as the consent granted for processing is revoked by you or the purpose for which the data is stored no longer applies or the data is no longer required for the purpose, unless its further storage is required for evidence purposes or this is contrary to statutory storage obligations (Art. 6 (1) 1 c) GDPR). When the prescribed retention period expires, your data will be blocked or deleted, unless the storage is still necessary for the conclusion or fulfilment of a contract.

### Existence of automated decision making

We do not use automatic decision making or profiling.
